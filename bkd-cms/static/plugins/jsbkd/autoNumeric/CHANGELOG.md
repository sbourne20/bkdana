+ Create an AutoNumericHolder ES6 class to store the field properties of an autoNumeric element.
+ Rename the AutoNumericHolder `init()` function to `_updateFieldProperties()`.
+ Rename the AutoNumericHolder functions that should be private.
+ Fix issue #283.
+ Rename `processAlways()` into `_processCharacterDeletion()`, and simplify it so that if does not do two things at the same time.
+ Rename `processKeypress()` into `_processCharacterInsertion()`, and simplify it so that if does not do two things at the same time.
+ Merge some conditions in `_formatQuick()`.
+ Remove the need for a jQuery dependency in the events listeners.
+ Convert some jQuery event listeners to pure JS event listeners.
+ Convert some jQuery-specific functions to native JS ones (ie. `$this.val()` to `e.target.value`).

+ The `getInitialSettings()` functions now calls the `calculateVMinAndVMaxIntegerSizes()`, `correctMDecOption()`, `setsAlternativeDecimalSeparatorCharacter()`, `cachesUsualRegularExpressions()` and `transformOptionsValuesToDefaultTypes()` functions.
+ Refactor the `update()` code into `getInitialSettings()`, which allows to remove the `autoCode()` calls from the AutoNumericHolder constructor and the `_updateFieldProperties()` function.
+ Remove the need for jQuery in `getSettings()`.
+ Modify the `validate()` test on the `mDec` option to allow for a positive integer too.
+ Allow the `autoFormat()` function to format numbers represented as a string.

+ Complete the `autoUnFormat()` tests and check for the value validity.
+ Modify the `autoUnFormat()` behavior so that when given a number (a real one or a string representing one), the function always return a 'real' number, whatever the options passed.
+ Modify the eslint 'radix' rule to allow for always specifying a radix for the `parseInt` function.
+ Comment out the default Jasmine test in order to see a 100% success without any skipped tests.
+ Fix the `clean:build` npm script so that it does not try to remove an inexistant folder.

### "2.0.0-beta.7"

### "2.0.0-beta.6"
+ Rename the `localOutput` setting to `outputType`, and add an option 'number' that makes `getLocalized` always return a Number, instead of a string.
+ Modify the `get` function so that it always returns a valid Number or string representing a number that Javascript can interpret.
+ Add a `getLocalized` function that return the raw value of the input, but can also return the value localized with a decimal point and negative sign placement chosen by the user (basically, it replace the old `get` behavior if any user wants it back).
+ Modify the `pNeg` default value based on the `aSign` and `pSign` values. This leads to better user experience when setting a currency symbol without setting `pNeg`.
+ Errors are now always thrown. The `debug` option now only affects the warning messages (used for non-critical errors).

### "2.0.0-beta.5"
+ Add a `validate()` method that checks if the given options object is valid.
+ Reorganize the `init` function code to check for critical error first, before doing other calculus.
+ Add a `areSettingsValid()` method that return true if the options object is valid.
+ Add multiple helper functions `isBoolean`, `isNull`, `isTrueOrFalseString`, `isObject`, `isEmptyObj`, `hasDecimals`,  `decimalsPlaces`.
+ Add a `warning()` method that output warning message to the console.

+ Modified the "update" method include calling the "getHolder" function which updates the regular expressions
+ Modified the "getHolder function so the regular expressions are updated
+ Modified the "set" method to convert value from number to string

#### Version 1.9.1

+ Modified the checkValue function to handle values as text with the exception of values less than "0.000001 and greater than -1"

#### Version 1.9.0

+ Fixed a rounding error when the integers were 15 or more digits in length
+ Added "use strict";

#### version 1.8.9

+ Fixed the "get" and "set" methods by moving the settings.oEvent property to ensure the error message would be thrown if the element had not been inialized prior to calling the "get" and "set" methods

#### Version 1.8.8

+ Fixed the "init" when there is a default and value aForm=true and the aSep and aDec are not the defaults

#### Version 1.8.7

+ Fixed the "getSting" method - it use to returned an error when no values were entered
+ Modified the "init" method to better handle default and pre-existing values
+ Modified the "set" method - removed the routine that checked for values less than .000001 and greater than -1 and placed it in a separate function named checkValue()
+ Modified the "get" method:
    + Added a call to the checkValue() function - this corrects returned values example - when the input value was "12." the returned value was "12." - it now returns "12"
    + When no numeric character is entered the returned value is an empty string "".

#### Version 1.8.6

+ Removed the error message when calling the 'init' methods multiple times. This was done when using the class selector for the 'init' method and then dynamically adding input(s) it allows you to use the same selector to init autoNumeric. **Please note:** if the input is already been initialized no changes to the option will occur you still need to use the update method to change exisiting options.
+ Added support for brackets '[,]', parentheses '(,)', braces '{,}' and '<,>' to the nBracket setting. **Please note:** the following format nBracket: '(,)' that the left and right symbol used to represent negative numbers must be enclosed in quote marks and separated by a comma to function properly.

#### Version 1.8.0

+ autoNumeric() 1.8.0 is not compatible with earlier versions but I believe you will find version 1.8.0's new functionality and ease of use worth the effort to convert.
